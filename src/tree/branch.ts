   * `Tree#expand` is called, the value of this will be immediately become `true`, however because
   * the child nodes of the branch in question might need to be loaded, the actual expansion won't
   * take effect until the children are loaded. So in that interim time while children are loading,
   * the branch isn't truly expanded even if the value is `true`.
   *
   * Depending on your use case you might want to rely on `Tree#isTrulyExpanded` for a "real-time" status.
